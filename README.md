ADF Test for Time Series Analysis

Introduction: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a statistical test used to determine whether a unit root is present in a time series dataset. It is commonly employed in time series analysis to check for the stationarity of a series. Stationarity is a crucial assumption in many time series models, as it ensures that the statistical properties of the series do not change over time.
Purpose: The purpose of this documentation is to provide an overview of the ADF test, its theoretical background, practical implementation in Python using libraries such as Statsmodels, and its interpretation in the context of time series analysis.


Stationarity Test for Time Series Analysis

Introduction: In time series analysis, stationarity is a fundamental concept. A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, remain constant over time. Testing for stationarity is crucial as many time series models assume that the underlying data is stationary. This documentation provides an overview of various stationary tests, their theoretical background, practical implementation in Python using libraries like Statsmodels, and interpretation in the context of time series analysis.
Purpose: The purpose of this documentation is to offer a comprehensive guide on stationary tests, the concept of stationarity is used to analyse the stock's differnt attributes , selecting appropriate tests, implementing them in Python, and interpreting the results for time series analysis.
